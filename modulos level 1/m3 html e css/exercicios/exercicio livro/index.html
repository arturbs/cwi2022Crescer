          <h3 class="chapter-paragraf"> 
            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. 
            With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Javascript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
        </h3>
        
          <h3 class="chapter-paragraf"> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as 
            interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics 
            for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other itens. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
            Tags such as <mark5>&lt;img /&gt;</mark5>  and <mark5>&lt;input /&gt;</mark5> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as 
            <mark5>&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</mark5> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
            Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
        </h3>
          <h3 class="chapter-paragraf"> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as Javascript which affect the behavior and content of web 
            pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintener of both the HTML and the CSS standards, 
            has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.

          <h3 class="chapter-paragraf"> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1980, physicist <u> Tim Berners-Lee</u>, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers 
            to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the 
            browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for 
            funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" 
            and put an encyclopedia first.
        </h3>
          <h3 class="chapter-paragraf"> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the HTML and HTML+ draft expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed 
                    "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.
